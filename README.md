# UT Registration

This library allows for manual course registration through Python!

To play around with it:

1. Customize `semester.py`.

2. Wait until your designated registration time.

3. Run `python register.py` to your heart's content!

_Disclaimer: this was just for fun, you should probably register by hand._
